# ShinyHuntingCounter

This program is a modified counter that is useful for shiny huning in various main series Pokémon games. 

## About Shiny Pokemon
A Shiny Pokémon "is a specific Pokémon with different coloration to what is usual for its species" 
(from [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Shiny_Pok%C3%A9mon)). They provide no benefit to the 
player, but Shiny pokemon do sparkle upon entering a battle. Shiny Pokémon are very rare. In some games, 
they are found as a 1/8192 chance. While there has been some methods to reduce these odds, Shiny Pokémon continue
to be rare and sought-after type of Pokémon with many people hunting them with different methods.

## About this Program
This program is essentially a counter. When a user first starts this program, a GUI will prompt them to input 
some data about the Pokémon they are trying to find, the odds of finding it and any shiny hunting methods they 
are using. They can also input a file with information about a shiny hunt they have saved.

After this, a new GUI will open showing a counter and some information about the hunt. At any point, the user
can click a button to increment the counter (or decrease if the user misclicked). Additionally, the user can
also save their progress so they can continue their hunt upon rerunning the program.

## Why I made this?
Sometime around April 2020, my friend showed me a spreadsheet of every Shiny Pokémon he managed to find incluing 
the methods and the amount of encounters it took, whenever it was applicable. I decided to do that aswell so I 
documented every Shiny I encountered in as far back as I remember. However, I never really kept track of how much
encounters it took. This was made apparent when almost all of the entries for the "encounters" section that were 
applicable were "Can't Remember". 

I made this program because I wanted to encourage myself to keep track of the encounters. Having a program that I 
made myself should help me want to use it and, in this case, keep track of encounters. Additionally, this program 
keeps track of extra data such as the encounter method, and the pokemon's name that would help when remembering
what to put on the spreadsheet.
