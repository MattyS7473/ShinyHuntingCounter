## About Shiny Pokemon
A Shiny Pokémon "is a specific Pokémon with different coloration to what is usual for its species" 
(from [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Shiny_Pok%C3%A9mon)). Shiny Pokémon, in some games, 
are found as a 1/8192 chance. While there has been some methods to reduce these odds, Shiny Pokémon continue
to be rare and sought-after types of Pokémon.

## About this Program
This program is essentially a counter. When a user first starts this program, a GUI will prompt them to input 
some data about the Pokémon they are trying to find, the odds of finding it and any shiny hunting methods they 
are using. They can also imput a file about another shiny hunt they have saved.

After this, a new GUI will open showing a counter and some information about the hunt. At any point, the user
can click a button to inciriment the counter (or decrease if the user misclicked). Additionally, the user can
also save their progress to be upened up upon rerunning the program.
